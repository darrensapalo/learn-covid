# Scope and Limitations

This study will be focused on data and patterns in Metro Manila (NCR) Philippines.

# Insights

Although my focus is primarily what is relevant to me (Metro Manila), other people can contextualize it 
to their own locations as well (e.g. Bataan, Cavite, Quezon City, etc). Once we've built up the groundwork
on how to make this information accessible.

Furthermore, translations of this information can be collaboratively worked on by contributors (e.g. Bisaya, Ilonggo, etc).

Hi. My name is Darren, and I am writing about my studies about COVID-19 in the context of Metro Manila (NCR) Philippines.

## Current state

I don't feel confident about leaving my house and I am erring on the side of being very conservative and not leaving and seeing people.

## Problem definition

This strategy works because of the minimization of risks, but there [must be an evaluation of the conservative strategy](/framing) to determine when this strategy ought to change.

## What do I want to accomplish?

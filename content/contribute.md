Does this kind of project interest you? If so, let's chat!

I think first of all, the simplest way that you can assist would 
be to [message me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/darrensapalo) so that I can
get a gauge of how interested people are on this topic, and generally
engage more people who may be interested here. 

It could be that you might be interested to do a likewise similar 
project but contextualized for your own local area (e.g. Cavite, 
Cebu, etc.). And that's a great idea and I fully support it!

I believe we should get together and have a short discussion where
we can see in which ways we align, so that we can collaborate and
work together to accomplish greater things.

## Channeling the masses

I firmly believe that the Filipino people are strong, resilient, and 
actively want to promote transformative change in their lives and the lives 
of their fellow Filipinos.

I hope that this movement of mine may inspire or attract like-minded 
individuals that want to make impactful good in our society.

# Primary data sources

To help me learn more about COVID-19, these are the data sources that I will be listening from. 
A hard requirement for these primary data sources are: that they are verified and scientific, and come from credible persons or organizations.

* [DOH Covid 19 Health Tracker](https://doh.gov.ph/covid19tracker) contextualized within Metro Manila (NCR)

# Secondary data sources

These are soft data sources which may not exactly be scientific or come from reknown organizations, but still
add useful information within the context of my analysis.

These can be personal blog accounts of close friends, youtube video of someone pursuing the same kind of observational study, etc.

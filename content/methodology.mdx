How do I intend to explore learning about COVID in a systematic and collaborative way?

# Methodology evaluation criteria

1. **The learning experience must be open**: The learnings should be openly shared with fellow students, 
and I want my learning experience not to be isolated (which is opens up possibilities of bias when left unchecked).

2. **The learning experience must be collaborative**: I want people to be able to easily contribute 
and help out in providing fresh information to people. In fact, if you are reading this now and are interested
to contribute, checkout the contribution guide.

# Methodology

The following is my initial draft of a methodology in my study of COVID 19. 
In case you have ideas on how this might be improved, [send me a GitHub issue detailing your suggestions or recommendations](https://github.com/darrensapalo/learn-covid/issues)!

1. Collect primary and secondary data sources; evaluate credibility

2. Come up wtih important contextualized questions that are pertinent to my use-case (Metro Manila study)

## Insights

Although my focus is primarily what is relevant to me (Metro Manila), other people can contextualize it 
to their own locations as well (e.g. Bataan, Cavite, Quezon City, etc). Once we've built up the groundwork
on how to make this information accessible.

Furthermore, translations of this information can be collaboratively worked on by contributors (e.g. Bisaya, Ilonggo, etc).
